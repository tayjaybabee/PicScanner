      and `extensions` attributes of the class. This method is used to update the collection after files have been added
      or removed.

      .. note::

         This method should be called after files have been added or removed from the collection. It will only reprocess
         the files if the `needs_reprocessing` attribute is set to `True`. After reprocessing, the `needs_reprocessing`
         attribute will be set to `False`.

      :returns: None

                               with the unit. If False, the size will be returned as a tuple with the size and the unit.
      :type return_as_string: bool

      :returns:     The total size of the extension and the unit.
      :rtype: tuple[Union[int, float], str]

   .. py:method:: remove_file(path: Union[pathlib.Path, str], **kwargs)

      Remove a file from the collection.

      This method removes a file from the collection. It takes a file path as an argument and removes the file from the
      collection. It then reprocesses the files in the collection to update the total size, total number of files, and
      total size of each extension.

      .. note::

         This method does not delete the file from the file system. It only removes the file from the collection,
         and only if the file is in the collection. If the file is not in the collection, this method will raise a
         `KeyError`. After removing the file, the collection will be reprocessed to update the total size, total number
         of files, and total size of each extension.

      :param path: The file path to remove.
      :type path: Union[Path, str]

   :type file_or_bytes: Union[str, bytes]
   :param maxsize: The maximum size of the image as a (width, height) tuple. Default is (1200, 850).
   :type maxsize: Tuple[int, int], optional

   :returns: The image data as a byte-string object in PNG format.
   :rtype: bytes

   :raises FileNotFoundError: If the specified file does not exist.
   :raises OSError: If the file cannot be opened and identified as an image file.
   :raises ValueError: If the input bytes object cannot be decoded into an image.


.. py:function:: flag_lock(instance, flag_name)

   Context manager to set and unset a private flag attribute in an instance.

   This context manager ensures that a specified private flag attribute
   in the given instance is set to True when entering the context and
   reset to False upon exiting the context. This is useful for indicating
   that an operation is in progress within a specific scope.

   :param instance: The instance containing the private flag attribute.
   :type instance: object
   :param flag_name: The name of the flag attribute (without leading underscore).
   :type flag_name: str

   :raises AttributeError: If the instance does not have the specified private flag attribute.

   Example usage:
       handler = OperationHandler()
       with flag_lock(handler, 'flag'):
           # Perform some operation
           pass

   This will automatically set handler._flag to True within the context
   and reset it to False when exiting the context.

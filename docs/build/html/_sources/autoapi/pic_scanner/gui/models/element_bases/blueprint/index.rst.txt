.. py:class:: AutoBuildMeta

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABCMeta`


   Metaclass for classes that should build themselves upon instantiation when the `auto_build`
   attribute is True.

   This metaclass overrides the `__call__` method to build the instance if the `auto_build`
   attribute is True.


.. py:class:: BaseBlueprint(auto_build: bool = False)

   A base class for building blueprints.

   This class is used to create blueprints for building GUI elements. A blueprint is a set of
   instructions that are used to build a GUI element.

   Properties:

       auto_build (bool):
           A boolean value that determines whether the class should automatically build itself when
           instantiated.

       building (bool):
           A boolean value that determines whether the class is currently building itself.

       is_built (bool):
           A boolean value that determines whether the class has been built.

       layout (list):
           A list of elements that make up the layout of the class.

   .. method:: build()

      
      An abstract method that builds the class.
      


   .. py:property:: auto_build
      Returns the value of the `auto_build` attribute.

      The `auto_build` attribute is a boolean value that determines whether the class should
      automatically build itself when instantiated.

      :returns:     The value of the `auto_build` attribute.
      :rtype: bool


   .. py:property:: building
      Returns the value of the `building` attribute.

      The `building` attribute is a boolean value that determines whether the class is currently building
      itself.

      :returns:     The value of the `building` attribute.
      :rtype: bool


   .. py:method:: building()

      Deletes the `building` attribute.

      This method sets the `building` attribute to `False`.

      :returns: None



   .. py:property:: is_built
      Returns the value of the `is_built` attribute.

      The `is_built` attribute is a boolean value that determines whether the class has been built.

      :returns:     The value of the `is_built` attribute.
      :rtype: bool


   .. py:property:: layout
      Returns the value of the `layout` attribute.

      The `layout` attribute is a list of elements that make up the layout of the class.

      :returns:     The value of the `layout` attribute.
      :rtype: list


   .. py:method:: build()
      :abstractmethod:


      An abstract method that builds the class.

      This method is called to build the class by creating and must be implemented by subclasses.

      :returns: None
